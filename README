This app implements a play framework 1.1 based payment service.
http://www.playframework.org

The payment gateway is BrainTree, and uses their JAVA API.

The current version uses a sandbox at BrainTree

Well now we can register a user (customer) at BrainTree and get his customer ID.
And I added a quick purchase transaction that uses a credit card that is already in the vault. It uses a credit card token so we store not cc data

1) From the main page click "New User"
2) Enter the required fields. Notice the validation errors and cool tooltips (you can even turn tooltips off)
3) Click "Register" to submit the user to the sandbox. If it fails it will flash the error. If it succeeds you are registered with BrainTree.
   If you click "Cancel" you are returned to the main login page.

If you want to make a purchase then:

1) Login as demo/demo on the main page
2) Click "Find Subscriptions", you should get a list os subscriptions
3) Click "View Details", a view of the subscription comes up. Click "Buy Subscription"
4) The Purchase Subscription page is displayed. Enter a start and end date (pop up calendar). Enter 16 digits for credit card, and a credit card name.
   NOTE: This will not be necessary in the next version, as a customer must enter a credit card into the vault.
5) Click "Purchase" and the Confirm Subscription Purchase page is displayed.
6) Click "Confirm" and the purchase is submitted to the sandbox. If it fails it will flash the error. If it succeeds you are returned to the main Subscription page.

TODO:
1) Add tooltips to more pages
2) Show subscriptions that have been purchased
3) Add credit card, address, billing address to vault
4) Config data for types of credit card validations
5) Internationalization
6) Convert in memory db to MySQL tables
7) I'm sure theres more
